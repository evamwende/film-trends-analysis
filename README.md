## Task Description
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## DATA 

Data was drawn from the following sources: [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)  and [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/) from which the data frames imdb_title_df, imdb_title_rating_df and tn_df were acquired and used in the analysis.

## Results

From the year 2010 t0 2019 the most common genre of movies produced were documentaries. We do see a slight shift in the year 202 where the dram genre takes prevelence.

**Item 3:Common characteristics of top rated movies in the last 10 years**

From the analysis in section two, we get to see how the top rated movies correlate with other aspects such as running time. It was noted that the top most rated movies had a runtime ranging from 40 to 80 minutes.

The top rated movies also belonged to the following genres 'Crime' 'Documentary' 'Comedy' 'Drama' 'Sport' 'Biography' 'Music' 'History' 'Adventure'. It is to be noted that a single movie could have more than one genre. It was noted that all movies did fall in the documentary category.

With the findings from Item 1 and the findings on item 3, we can see that the genre 'documentary' is the most preferred among the viewers and the producers

**Item 4:Profit trends over the past 10 years domestically and world wide_**

The findings show an up down in maximum profit gains over the years. It is to be noted that the domestic and international profits have almost the same trends. The peak years for both are 2015 and 2018.

However, a comparison of both shows that the international film market does bring in more revenue as compared to the domestic market over the years.

# Recommendations
1. Microsoft should target producing movies that lie in either of the following genres 'Crime' 'Documentary' 'Comedy' 'Drama' 'Sport' 'Biography' 'Music' 'History' 'Adventure' with a major focus on Documentaries

2. The Microsoft film should have a runtime of between 40 to 80 minutes.

3. Mircosoft should not only target having their film in the domestic market but also international one in order to maximise on profit.
